        Petential aims to address the ever growing problem of
        finding good homes for animals by matching users with a
        pet that will best compliment their living situation using a
        complex matching algorithm.

    <string name="p2">
        Petential will analyze the information you provide to the profile
        with its matching algorithm. The user\'s ideal pet will be
        ranked. Each option will include an instructional video and a map
        to stores that sell that type of pet.

        We hope that by using this app we can match you to the animal
        companion that best compliments your living situation.
